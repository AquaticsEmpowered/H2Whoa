# Aquatics Empowered

H2Whoa is an web application that will raise awareness of Aquatics Empowered as well as rehabilitative uses of water therapy in rural communities. This was achieved through a story landing page where the user can upload their story of water therapy as well as photos of their story. There is an about page that will have details on Aquatics Empowered, Hot Tubbing for Hope, Troy Derheim, and the work that is being done to raise awareness of water therapy. The user will have the ability to search and filter the stories on the story page feed. The admin will have the ability to hide and add new categories, as well as delete and edit stories added by users. Admins will also be able to view, edit, and delete any posts that users have ‘flagged.’ They will be able to access these posts from the admin page.
